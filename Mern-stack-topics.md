# Backend Development Roadmap

### 1. Basics of Web Servers and Protocols
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Request-Response model, status codes (200, 404, 500).
- **RESTful APIs**: Concepts and best practices.
- **JSON**: Data format for communication.

### 2. Node.js Basics
- Node.js environment setup and running JavaScript code outside the browser.
- Basics of the **event loop** and asynchronous programming (callbacks, promises, async/await).
- Understanding `require()` vs `import`, and how to export modules.

### 3. Express.js Framework
- Setting up an Express server.
- Routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Middleware concept (built-in and custom middleware).
- Error handling and response management.

### 4. Database Integration
- Learn MongoDB for NoSQL database (start with MongoDB Atlas).
- Understand how to connect MongoDB with Node.js using **Mongoose**.
- Learn CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
- Schema design basics.

### 5. Authentication and Security
- JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
- Hashing passwords using `bcrypt`.
- Basic security practices: CORS, helmet, rate limiting.

### 6. Deployment
- Deploy your backend server to platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or Render.
- Use environment variables (`dotenv`) for managing sensitive data like API keys.

## Projects to Build (Step-by-Step)

### Project 1: Simple To-Do App (Beginner)
- **What you'll learn**:
  - REST API basics.
  - CRUD operations using MongoDB.
  - Basic routing in Express.js.
- **Features to implement**:
  - Add a task, delete a task, update a task, and view all tasks.
  - Store tasks in MongoDB.

### Project 2: User Authentication System
- **What you'll learn**:
  - User registration and login system.
  - Password hashing with `bcrypt`.
  - JWT for authentication.
- **Features to implement**:
  - User signup and login with proper validations.
  - Protect certain routes that require authentication.

### Project 3: Notes Management API
- **What you'll learn**:
  - Working with relational data (users and their notes).
  - Implementing middleware for authentication.
- **Features to implement**:
  - Users can create, update, and delete their notes.
  - Notes should belong only to the logged-in user.

### Project 4: Blog API
- **What you'll learn**:
  - Relationships in MongoDB (e.g., Users and their blog posts).
  - Pagination and filtering in API responses.
- **Features to implement**:
  - CRUD for blog posts.
  - Commenting system (with nested comments).
  - Pagination for listing blogs.

### Project 5: E-Commerce Backend (Intermediate)
- **What you'll learn**:
  - Advanced MongoDB queries (aggregation).
  - Session or JWT-based authentication.
- **Features to implement**:
  - Product listing and filtering by category, price, etc.
  - User cart management (add/remove products).
  - Admin panel for managing products.

## Learning Approach
1. **Start Small**:
   - Begin with simple projects like a to-do app to understand CRUD operations and APIs.
2. **Experiment**:
   - Add new features like authentication or relationships to each project.
3. **Use Version Control**:
   - Use Git and GitHub to manage your projects.
4. **Deploy Your Projects**:
   - Deploy your APIs online using platforms like Heroku or Render.

---

## Suggested Timeline
- **Week 1â€“2**: Basics of Node.js, Express.js, and CRUD operations (Project 1).
- **Week 3â€“4**: Database integration and authentication (Projects 2 and 3).
- **Week 5**: Pagination, filtering, and deployment (Project 4).
- **Week 6+**: Build a full-fledged backend for e-commerce (Project 5).
